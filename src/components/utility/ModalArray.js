The website features a responsive design, user authentication (login, logout), the ability to generate basic single-page html sites (as well as download them onto your PC). This website was designed by both Jonathan Nanno and Sheldon Codling, with Jonathan focusing more on the front-end and Sheldon focusing more on the back-end as well as hosting. This project is currently being revised and has lost a few of its features.",
